# ContactList

Some piece of code I wrote for fun years ago.
A contact list implemented with XML using the XOM api. Supports adding/deleting/searching for names, addresses, etc.
Can be easily modified to include other personal details such as telephone numbers, student number, etc. The UI is seperated from the actual database. Read src for details.
Src is very well documented (I commented according to high school standard, meaning very detailed). I hope it is self explanatory.

If you actually need a contact list, I suggest looking at mySQL instead. It has many more functionalities.
